% % % 4. PART4_PREDICT_INTERACTIONS - predicting occurrence of mutations from 
% the binary sequence of major drivers, validation of interactions and
% survival analysis


%%%This code is divided into 3 directories:


% % % 1. PREDICT_PASSANFGERS_FROM_DRIVERS - using the sequence of drivers
% to predict each passanger, for lung and colon.
% WARNING!!!! THIS CODE REQUIRES A VERY LONG RUNNING TIME (may take A
% few days on HPC). The results for both lung and colon are saved as
% 'RES.mat' in the COLON, LUNG directories


% % % 2. COLON - pairing passanges with drivers, validation of predicted
% interactions and survival analysis for colon cancer

% % % 2. LUNG - pairing passanges with drivers, validation of predicted
% interactions and survival analysis for lung cancer
