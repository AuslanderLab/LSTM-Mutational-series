## System requirements: 
1. MATLAB has to be installed. 
2. The following packages should be installed:
  a. Deep Learning Toolbox
  b. Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## Version checked on: MATLAB2018a,MATLAB2018b
## OS tested: mac OS 10.12.6 and 10.10.5, NIH HPC linux cluster

## This code has four parts 
1. PART1_PREDICT_LOAD - predict mutational load from a time series of mutations
2. PART2_PREDICT_SEQ - predict the next mutation in the time-sequence
3. PART3_CONSTRUCT_DATA - construction of simulated mutational data
4. PART4_PREDICT_INTERACTIONS - predicting occurrence of mutations from 

the binary sequence of major drivers, validation of interactions and survival analysis
each part contains a separate, detailed README file
